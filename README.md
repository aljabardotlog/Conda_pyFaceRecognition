# Conda_pyFaceRecognition

Reference http://bit.ly/2YU11RF

Install pipenv by
	$pip install pipenv

install face_recognition library by run
	$pipenv install face_recognition

note 
“To install face_recognition, we need some libraries, so if you dont want to think alot, install face_recognition by root (Mac). However, when u have a problem with dlib or others libraries, install it by root. On the other hand, use conda to make everything easier as my practice”

Let’s do it

1. We can detect the image face 
  $face_detection ./folder_master ./folder_detection  
  
  - don’t forget to look in to pixel of picture that you are using in the practice
  
2. We can use this source code to know how many people in the picture




Wait for the next code…


Enjoy It ;)
